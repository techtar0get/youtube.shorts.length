YouTube Shorts is a way for anyone to connect with a new audience using just a smartphone and the Shorts camera in the YouTube app. YouTube's Shorts creation tools makes it easy to create short-form videos that are up to 60 seconds long with our multi-segment camera.

## What are YouTube Shorts?

YouTube Shorts are short-form, vertical video content created using a smartphone and uploaded directly to YouTube from the YouTube app.

Using YouTube’s built-in creation tools, you can capture, edit, add music from major labels (including Sony, Universal, and Warner), add animated text, control the speed of your footage, and edit together multiple 15-second video clips to create your Shorts.

Viewers of your Shorts can share, comment, like, dislike, or subscribe to your channel while viewing the video. The content doesn’t disappear and remains on YouTube, unlike other short-form video apps like Instagram Stories and Snapchat.

## How long can YouTube Shorts be? 

* The maximum duration of a Youtube Shorts video is 60 seconds.
* The ideal duration is between 15 and 60 seconds.
* If you are using Stock music or your own Audio, your video can be between 15 and 60 seconds.
* But, if you are choosing a music track from the YouTube catalog, then your video duration will be limited to up to 15 seconds.
